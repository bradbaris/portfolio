      p At Joint Base Pearl Harbor Hickam, I worked at the Navy MWR on Great Life Hawaii magazine, designing ads for the many recreational activities on base. I also did a lot of photography work for editorials and events. In total, I worked on hundreds of ads and dozens of projects. Here are a few of the kinds of magazine ads I created.
