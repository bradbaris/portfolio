      p One of the projects I worked on while at Chaminade University was to rollout their inaugural email communications. This included setting up Salesforce Marketing Cloud CRM as well as designing and developing a myriad of email templates, which were guaranteed to work across all nearly email clients, thanks to Litmus.
      p I also helped advise on future server infrastructure and technical decisions, as well as spearheaded the adoption of Workplace by Facebook internally in an effort to improve cross-departmental collaboration.
