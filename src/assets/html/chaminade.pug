      p While at Chaminade University, I rolled out their inaugural email communications. After provisioning a Salesforce Marketing Cloud instance, I developed software to facilitate the email development process, as well as designed a myriad of email templates compatible with nearly all email clients.
      p Another thing I did: spearheaded the adoption of Workplace by Facebook internally in an effort to improve cross-departmental collaboration.
