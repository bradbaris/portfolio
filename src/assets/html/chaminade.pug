      p While at Chaminade University, I rolled out their inaugural email communications. After provisioning a Salesforce Marketing Cloud instance, I developed software to facilitate the email development process, as well as designed a myriad of email templates compatible with nearly all email clients. Aside from this, I spearheaded an effort to improve cross-departmental collaboration by championing Workplace by Facebook internally.
